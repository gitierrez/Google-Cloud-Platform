    "\n",
    "* Very fast scanning and high throughput\n",
    "* Non-structured key/value data\n",
    "* Each data item is smaller than 10 MB\n",
    "* Total data is larger than 1TB\n",
    "* Time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid BigTable when...\n",
    "\n",
    "* OLTP - use Cloud SQL or Spanner\n",
    "* Data is less than 1TB (can't parallelize efficiently)\n",
    "* Analytics/BI/Warehousing - use BigQuery\n",
    "* Documents or highly structured hierarchies - use DataStore\n",
    "* Immutable blobs like movies - use Cloud Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hotspotting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to Cloud Spanner, data is stored in a sorted lexicographical order of keys\n",
    "* Data is distributed based on key values\n",
    "* Poor performance when:\n",
    "  * Read/writes are concentrated in some ranges\n",
    "  * Sequential key values\n",
    "* Salting: use hashing of key values\n",
    "* Field promotion: use in reverse URL order like Java package names - similar prefixes, different endings\n",
    "* BigTable will improve performance over time by observing read and write patterns and redistributing data so that shards are evenly hit\n",
    "* BigTable will try to store roughly the same amount of data in different nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Schema design\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each table has just one index - the row key. Choose it well\n",
    "  * Use: reverse domain names, strings, keys with timestamp suffixes\n",
    "  * Avoid: domain names, sequential numeric values, timestamps alone or as prefixes, mutable or repeatedly updated values\n",
    "* Rows are sorted lexicographically\n",
    "* Operations are atomic at row level\n",
    "* Related entities are stored in adjacent rows thanks to column families\n",
    "* Row keys should be smaller than 4KB per key\n",
    "* Less than 100 column families per table\n",
    "* Column values less than 10MB each\n",
    "* Total row size less than 100MB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasons for poor perfomance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Poor schema design (sequential keys)\n",
    "* Small datasets\n",
    "* Used for short times\n",
    "* Cluster too small\n",
